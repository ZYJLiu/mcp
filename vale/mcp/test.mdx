## Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)

Solana on-chain programs compile via the
LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) compiler infrastructure to an
[Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)
containing a variation of the
[Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter)
bytecode.

Because Solana uses the LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) compiler infrastructure, developers can write programs
in any programming language that can target LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) BPF backend.

BPF provides an efficient
[instruction set](https://github.com/iovisor/bpf-docs/blob/master/eBPF.md) that
runs in an interpreted virtual machine or as efficient just-in-time
compiled native instructions.

## Memory map

The virtual address memory map used by Solana SBF (Solana Berkeley Filter) programs has a fixed layout
as follows:

- Program code starts at address range beginning with 0×100000000
- Stack data starts at address range beginning with 0×200000000
- Heap data starts at address range beginning with 0×300000000
- Program input parameters start at address range beginning with 0×400000000

These virtual addresses mark starting points, but programs receive access to
a subset of the memory map. The program panics if it attempts to read or
write to a virtual address outside its granted access, and an
`AccessViolation` error shows the address and size of the attempted violation.

## InvalidAccountData

This program error can occur for specific reasons. Typically, it happens when
passing an account to the program that the program doesn't expect, either in
the wrong position in the instruction or an account incompatible with the
instruction running.

A program implementation might also trigger this error when performing a
cross-program instruction without providing the account for the program
that needs calling.

## InvalidInstructionData

This program error can occur during instruction deserialization. Verify
that the structure passed in matches exactly what the instruction expects. Look for
padding between fields. If the program implements the Rust `Pack` trait, try
packing and unpacking the instruction type `T` to determine the exact encoding
the program expects.

## MissingRequiredSignature

Some instructions require a signed account; this error appears if
an account should have a signature but doesn't.

A program implementation might also trigger this error when performing a
[cross-program invocation](/docs/core/cpi) that requires a signed program
address, but the signer seeds passed to `invoke_signed` don't match the
signer seeds used to create the program address with
[`create_program_address`](/docs/core/pda#createprogramaddress).

## Stack

SBF (Solana Berkeley Filter) uses stack frames instead of a variable stack pointer. Each stack frame
contains 4KB.

If a program exceeds that stack frame size, the compiler shows an
overrun warning.

For example:

```text
Error: Function _ZN16curve25519_dalek7edwards21EdwardsBasepointTable6create17h178b3d2411f7f082E Stack offset of -30728 exceeded max offset of -4096 by 26632 bytes, please reduce large stack variables
```

The message shows which symbol exceeds its stack frame, but the name
might appear in mangled form.

> To decode a Rust symbol, use a symbol decoder tool.

The preceding warning came from a Rust program. The readable symbol name appears as:

```shell
demangling-tool _ZN16curve25519_dalek7edwards21EdwardsBasepointTable6create17h178b3d2411f7f082E
curve25519_dalek::edwards::EdwardsBasepointTable::create
```

The compiler produces a warning rather than an error because some dependent
crates may include features that exceed the stack frame restrictions even
if the program doesn't use that capability. If the program exceeds the stack
size at runtime, the system reports an `AccessViolation` error.

SBF (Solana Berkeley Filter) stack frames occupy a virtual address range starting at 0×200000000.

## Heap size

Programs can access a runtime heap via the Rust `alloc` interfaces. For fast
allocations, a simple 32KB bump heap serves this purpose. The heap doesn't support
`free` or memory reallocation.

Internally, programs can access the 32KB memory region starting at virtual
address 0×300000000 and may create a custom heap based on specific needs.

Rust programs define the heap directly by setting a custom
[`global_allocator`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/d9b0fc0e3eec67dfe4a97d9298b15969b2804fab/sdk/program/src/entrypoint.rs#L72)

## Loaders

Programs deploy with and run through runtime loaders. Currently, two loaders exist:
[BPF Loader](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7ddf10e602d2ed87a9e3737aa8c32f1db9f909d8/sdk/program/src/bpf_loader.rs#L17)
and
[BPF loader deprecated](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7ddf10e602d2ed87a9e3737aa8c32f1db9f909d8/sdk/program/src/bpf_loader_deprecated.rs#L14)

Loaders may support different app binary interfaces, so developers must
write programs for and deploy them to the same loader. If you deploy a program
written for one loader to a different one, this often causes an
`AccessViolation` error due to mismatched deserialization of the program's input
parameters.

For practical purposes, always write programs to target the latest
BPF loader. The latest loader serves as the default for both the command-line interface
and the JavaScript interfaces.

### Deployment

SBF (Solana Berkeley Filter) program deployment uploads a BPF shared object into a
program account's data and marks the account executable. A client divides the
BPF shared object into smaller pieces and sends them as the instruction data of
[`Write`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/bc7133d7526a041d1aaee807b80922baa89b6f90/sdk/program/src/loader_instruction.rs#L13)
instructions to the loader. The loader stores that data in the program's
account data. After sending all pieces, the client sends a
[`Complete`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/bc7133d7526a041d1aaee807b80922baa89b6f90/sdk/program/src/loader_instruction.rs#L30)
instruction to the loader. The loader then validates the BPF data and
marks the program account as _executable_. After marking the program account
executable, transactions can issue instructions for that
program to process.

When an instruction targets an executable BPF program, the loader
sets up the program's execution environment, serializes the program's input
parameters, calls the program's entrypoint, and reports any errors encountered.

For further information, see [deploying programs](/docs/programs/deploying).

### Input Parameter Serialization

BPF loaders serialize program input parameters into a byte array that passes
to the program's entrypoint. The program then must deserialize it on-chain. One change between the deprecated loader and
the current loader involves parameter serialization: parameters now align on specific offsets within the aligned byte
array. This allows deserialization implementations to reference the
byte array directly and provide aligned pointers to the program.

- [Rust program parameter deserialization](/docs/programs/lang-rust#parameter-deserialization)

The latest loader serializes program input parameters as follows (all
encoding uses little-endian):

- 8 bytes unsigned number of accounts
- For each account
  - 1 byte indicating if this duplicates an account. Value 0xff means not a duplicate,
    otherwise the value indicates the index of the account it duplicates.
  - If duplicate: 7 bytes of padding
  - If not duplicate:
    - 1 byte Boolean, true if account has a signer
    - 1 byte Boolean, true if account allows writing
    - 1 byte Boolean, true if account allows execution
    - 4 bytes of padding
    - 32 bytes of the account public key
    - 32 bytes of the account's owner public key
    - 8 bytes unsigned number of lamports owned by the account
    - 8 bytes unsigned number of bytes of account data
    - x bytes of account data
    - 10k bytes of padding, for memory reallocation
    - enough padding to align the offset to 8 bytes
    - 8 bytes rent epoch
- 8 bytes of unsigned number of instruction data
- x bytes of instruction data
- 32 bytes of the program id
